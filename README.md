# Visual A* PathFinding Demo

This is a simple version application of A-star pathfinding using Unity and C#.

## Run the Demo
The built application can be obtained by the .zip file. To play with this demo, move your mouse on the board and click to select the starting point and hover around to see the "current ending point" and the path from start to end.

You can also build walls and obstacles by enbaling the "drawing walls" option, to see how the path will look like when there are obstacles on the board.
